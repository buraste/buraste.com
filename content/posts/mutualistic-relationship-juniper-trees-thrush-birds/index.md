Today, my boss came to our room, "Have you heard of juniper trees?" he asked and started talking about them. I learned a lot of things about juniper trees and thrush birds.

Unlike others; Juniper trees can't self proliferate. They need help to proliferating. Meanwhile, their best friends help them for this awesome natural phenomenon: Thrush birds. Thrush birds ingest to juniper trees' seeds and do the toilet to soil. Juniper seeds sprout out from soil.

I had never heard of a bird called "thrush" before. When I wonder and look at the image, I remembered it. It looks like ouzel (or ousel/blackbird, "Karatavuk" in Turkish). But they have different colors. My late father had shown me a lot of times when I was a child.

If thrushs left that area or if its generations are exhausted, juniper trees are also extinct. So sadly but also amazing! If you want to see a few you should visit West Mediterranean or Middle Anatolian area.

Finally, If you interest birds and want to listen birds sounds, [link is here](https://www.birdid.no/bird/eBook.php?specieID=1130&compareSpecieID=1599)

**Wikipedia definition about Juniper tree**: Depending on taxonomic viewpoint, between 50 and 67 species of junipers are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere, from the Arctic, south to tropical Africa, from Ziarat, Pakistan, east to eastern Tibet in the Old World, and in the mountains of Central America. The highest-known juniper forest occurs at an altitude of 16,000 ft (4,900 m) in southeastern Tibet and the northern Himalayas, creating one of the highest tree-lines on earth.
