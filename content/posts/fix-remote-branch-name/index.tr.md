You created branch and write some of codes, pushed to remote but suddenly you noticed that the branch name was incorrect! Ahh.. Don't worry, you can change easily your branch name:

- Firstly change local branch name on your branch:

```
git branch -m new-name
```

- Push that to remote:

```
git push origin :old-name new-name
```

Your old shitty branch and merge request will delete and you can open new merge request with same changes. You don't lose your changes.

## Here are some Git commands that will help:

br = branch name
sb = source branch
tb = target branch
obr = old branch name
nbr = new branch name
