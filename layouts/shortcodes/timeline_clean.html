            (daily profit reports etc.) to company owners on my manager behalf,
            he said no one should know this üôÉ I am really idiot. But I learned
            Visual Basic and I become master of Excel. Excel started to take
            care of many manual things that our department had to do. So my CEO,
            CFO, managers that I send regular mail loved me. Because they saw
            "manager-friendly" spreadsheets, auto-generated mails (not
            complicated Excel files attached), clear and straightforward
            call-to-action reports. When I got new job offer, my CFO said "If
            you leave, you can't come back! This is last chance" and offered me
            double my salary. But this is not poker and we don't play a game
            idiot. He should work hard or need to find someone to email him on

            chance for self-development and learning all of things such a sales,
            marketing, accounting and of course business analytics. I am Excel

            that's a little too much. Because Excel is not a
            object-relationship-database. You neet to build relationships. You
            can't create tests, you can't work on huge datasets. If you
            calculate huge datasets with complex rules, you must to use
            applications where you can set rules and manage rules. They don't
            have and all of responsibility is on your shoulders. This is too
            much stress. You can't create/develop things, just calculate. You
            are calculator If you just calculate and prepare reports so you may
            run out of charge, may make a mistake. But I met WordPress and PHP
            at there. After that I learned Python & Django for developing own
            tools. I developed a career website that accept job applications for

            cause of works and we needed money to spend our free time. So we
            needed to earn money another way while we were working. We wanted to
            sell something we used. We just wanted to try make natural incense
            and handmade natural candles. We took a very small amount of
            material and made it in one day. Yes, we could! So why don't we sell
            them? We found a brand name: Hello Minaste, purchase domain and from
            night to morning I created a website with WordPress and WooCommerce.

            ads, SEO, payment gateways, product photography, I realized I can
            sell these too. Why not?

            My wedding dress has a special meaning for me. Because it belonged
            to my father.

          <small
            >I learned a lot about Next.js and also love the new tech
            interfaces. So I started migrating Minaste Blog from WordPress to
            Next.js and of course redesigning everything. The hardest part was
            getting used to WordPress' instant update feature. If you see any
            bugs you have to release the new version so this was a bit of a
            hassle for me at first.</small
